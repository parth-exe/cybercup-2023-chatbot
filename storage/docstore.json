They act as sources of drinking water, recharge groundwater, control floods, support biodiversity, and provide livelihood opportunities to a large number of people.\n\nCurrently, a major water crisis is being faced by India, where 100 million people are on the frontlines of a nationwide water crisis and many major cities facing an acute water shortage.\n\nThe situation will worsen as United Nations and Niti Ayog reports say that the demand for water will reach twice the available supply, and 40 per cent of India\u2019s population will not have access to clean drinking water by 2030.\t\n\nOne of the reasons is our increasing negligence and lack of conservation of waterbodies. Since independence, the government has taken control over the waterbodies and water supply.\n\nWith a colonial mindset, authorities move further and further away in the quest of water supply, emphasing more on networks, infrastructure and construction of dams.\n\nThis, over time, has led to the neglect of waterbodies and catchments areas. As a result, we have started valuing land more than water.\n\nIn the last few decades, waterbodies have been under continuous and unrelenting stress, caused primarily by rapid urbanisation and unplanned growth. Encroachment of waterbodies has been identified as a major cause of flash floods in Mumbai (2005), Uttarakhand (2013), Jammu and Kashmir (2014) and Chennai (2015).\n\nFurther, waterbodies are being polluted by untreated effluents and sewage that are continuously being dumped into them. Across the country, 86 waterbodies are critically polluted, having a chemical oxygen demand or COD concentration of more than 250 mg/l, which is the discharge standard for a polluting source such as sewage treatment plants and industrial effluent treatment plants.\nIn urban India, the number of waterbodies is declining rapidly. For example, in the 1960s Bangalore had 262 lakes. Now, only 10 hold water.\n\nSimilarly, in 2001, 137 lakes were listed in Ahmedabad. However, by 2012, 65 were already destroyed and built upon.  Hyderabad is another example. In the last 12 years, it has lost 3,245 hectares of its wetlands.\n\nThe decline in both the quality and quantity of these waterbodies is to the extent that their potential to render various economic and environmental services has reduced drastically.\n\nAlthough there are sufficient polices and acts for protection and restoration of waterbodies, they remain insufficient and ineffective.\n\n\n\nThe Ganges River is the most polluted river in India.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

there is not enough infrastructure to provide clean water.Another reason is that many people in India do not have access to proper sanitation.This means that they do not have toilets or places to dispose of their waste properly.This leads to a lot of waste being dumped into the country\u2019s rivers and lakes.Another reason is that India has a lot of industry.This means that there is a lot of pollution from factories.Lastly, India is a very crowded country.This means that there is not much space for people to live and there is a lot of traffic.This leads to a lot of pollution from cars and

necessary goods and services. Aquatic biodiversity can be defined as the variety of life and the ecosystems that make up the freshwater, tidal, and marine regions of the world, as well as all their interactions. The biodiversity of water bodies provides a number of services that affect human health and well-being directly and indirectly. For humans, aquatic ecosystems represent a source of water, food, materials as well as a room for recreation, commercial fishing, and tourism. Another huge importance of water bodies comes with the aquatic plants and animals and their ecological functions for our survival. Each day, aquatic organisms (bacteria and fungi) continually break down harmful toxins and nutrients that we flush into our sewage systems or discard directly into our rivers and streams. Some of the other very important benefits of blue spaces include flood prevention, trapping sediments and contaminants, retaining nutrients and maintaining biodiversity, which supports the ecosystem functions. A water body also represents a buffer for new diseases, it creates job opportunities in places rich in tourism and provides a source for medicine.The importance of bodies of water cannot be overstated and are part of our lives in many forms. Nowadays, when the world needs a solution to tackle climate change and food shortages, water bodies can be a part of that solution. Today, 75% of humanities\u2019 food is generated from only 12 plants and five animal species, which makes the food system less resilient to diseases, pests, and climate change. .Many new researches can confirm that being surrounded by nature reduces stress levels and improves one\u2019s mood and general mental health.

Globally, more people live in urban areas than in rural areas, with 55 % of the world\u2019s population residing in urban areas in 2018. In 1950, about 70% of the world\u2019s population lived in rural settlements. By 2007, the year saw, for the first time in history, global urban populations exceeding global rural populations, and the amount of people living or moving to the cities has continued to grow at an even more rapid speed. It is projected that by 2050, the world will be more than two thirds urban (68%), roughly the reverse of the global rural-urban population distribution of the mid-twentieth century.\n\nMoving to the cities can be for various reasons. Either there are better job opportunities, a pursuant for  education, or simply a preference for a technologically advanced lifestyle. For many living in rural regions, it can represent a life coupled with hardships and that of reduced opportunities for a diverse social life. \n\nYet urbanisation has been necessary for the development of the world economy. In most parts of the world however, it has had a very unfavourable effect on environmental sustainability and surface water. Building up cities linked with higher water usage and increasing impervious layers result in the declination of water. Every day, cities across the world move 504 billion litres of water across 27,000km to hydrate their populations and industries. According to new World Resources Institute data, 17 countries around the world are currently under extremely high water stress, meaning they are using almost all the water they have.\n\n\n\n\n\nRealising the seriousness of the problem confronting waterbodies, the Centre had launched the Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies' scheme in 2005 with the objectives of comprehensive improvement and restoration of traditional waterbodies.These included increasing tank storage capacity, ground water recharge, increased availability of drinking water, improvement of catchment areas of tank commands and others.However, in this regard, not much has been seen on the ground.Experts say that cities may not run out of water if urban planning engages more critically with the city\u2019s terrain, along with propagation of knowledge about the local history of lakes, meaningful community engagement and ownership of waterbodies.This is backed by the seminal publications of Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (a Global Think tank) such as Fourth Citizen's report: Dying Wisdom, Making Water Everybody\u2019s Business: Policy and Practice of Water Harvesting and Excreta Matters, which talk about waterbodies being an important source of water, their protection through community management and the need of a comprehensive act for the protection of

time-bound, mission-mode water conservation campaign initiated by the new Jal Shakti ministry is a welcoming step focussing on rainwater harvesting, rejuvenation of waterbodies, reuse of treated wastewater, and intensive afforestation.It is of utmost importance for meeting the rising demand for water augmentation, improving the health of waterbodies as they provide various ecosystem services that are required to manage microclimate, biodiversity and nutrient cycling.Many cities are working towards conservation of waterbodies like the steps initiated in the capital city of Delhi for instance.In turning Delhi into a city of lakes, rejuvenation of 201 waterbodies has been finalised.Of these, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) plans to revive 155 bodies while the Flood and Irrigation Department will revive 46.DJB claims that the aim is to achieve biological oxygen demand or BOD to 10ppm and total suspended solids to 10mg/l.Also the establishment of the Wetlands Authority by the Delhi government is a welcome step towards notifying and conserving natural waterbodies.In order to achieve the goal of revival of waterbodies, it is important to understand that one solution may not fit all the waterbodies.Depending on the purpose, ecological services, livelihood and socio-cultural practices, the approach will vary from one waterbody to another.However the issues with regard to lack of data and action plans, encroachments, interrupted water flow from the catchment, siltation, violations of laws, solid waste deposit and polluted water, involvement of too many agencies, etc have to be taken into consideration.Action needs to be taken towards:\n\n1.Attaining sustainability.Thus, emphasis on long-term goals, operation and maintenance should be included along with the allocation of budget.2.Success of the lakes should be tested on all three fronts namely economic, environmental and social.Many studies point that a deliberate effort has to be made on the social front for which better publicity of the environmental benefits of the project and enhancing environmental awareness, especially among the local community is required.3.Encouraging local people to collaborate with other stakeholders to successfully utilise resources and ensure the protection and conservation of waterbodies.Traditionally, water was seen as a responsibility of citizens and the community collectively took the responsibility of not only building but also of maintaining the waterbodies.This needs to be brought back into the system.Thus, an integrated approach taking into account the long-term sustainability, starting from the planning stage where looking at every waterbody along with its catchment, is required.To make it a reality, it is time to invest in governance, capacitating our institutions, strong regulations and enforcements or else we will fall back.Let us not destroy our waterbodies in the name of development.Rather, we should value their importance.",

designates water body as any natural or man-made structure used for storing water for various purposes, such as irrigation, industry, fish farming, domestic use, recreation, religious activities, and groundwater recharge\n    Any structure that collects and stores water from melting ice, streams, springs, rain, or drainage from residential or other areas, or stores water diverted from a stream, nala, or river, is also considered a water body.Categories of water bodies\n\n    Ponds comprise 59.5%\n    Tanks at 15.7%\n    Reservoirs at 12.1%\n    Water conservation projects such as percolation tanks and check dams at 9.3%\n    Lakes at 0.9%\n    Other types at 2.5%\n\nState-wise distribution of water bodies\n\n    West Bengal has the highest number of ponds and reservoirs.Andhra Pradesh hosts highest number of tanks.Tamil Nadu has the highest number of lakes.Maharashtra is leading in terms of water conservation initiatives.Usage pattern of water bodies\n\n    The majority of them are used for fish farming, with other uses being irrigation, replenishing groundwater, and providing water for household and drinking needs.About 55.5% are dedicated to fish farming\n        16.5% to irrigation\n        12.1% to groundwater replenishment\n        10.1% to domestic and drinking water needs\n        Remaining is used for recreational, industrial, religious and other purposes.State-wise pattern of usage\n\n    50% of the water bodies are used for fish farming in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Tripura, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Assam and the eastern States of West Bengal and Odisha.Over 50% of the water bodies are used for irrigation in Gujarat, Telangana, Karnataka and Jharkhand.More than 50% are used for drinking in Manipur and Himachal Pradesh.Over 10% of the water bodies in Sikkim are used for recreational purposes.Over 50% of the water bodies in Uttarakhand, Punjab and Maharashtra are used for groundwater recharge.Industrial usage of water bodies is minimal in all the States.Urban and rural distribution\nOver 97.1% of water bodies can be found in rural regions while only 2.9% are located in urban areas.Use: About 83.7% of water bodies are currently in use, while the rest are unused due to factors such as construction, siltation, irreparable damage, and industrial effluents.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,
